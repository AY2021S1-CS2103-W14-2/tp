ConciergeBook is a desktop app for hotel receptionists to efficiently
manage guest bookings via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br/>
If you can type fast, ConciergeBook can help you optimise how you manage your rooms,
your guests and all new and existing bookings - faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start
* Ensure you have `java 11` installed.
* Download the jar file.
* Run `java -jar {jarFileName}.jar` in your terminal/cmd.

## Main features
1. Check in and check out guests 
2. Keep track of guests who have used the hotel
3. Charge guests the bill upon checkout
