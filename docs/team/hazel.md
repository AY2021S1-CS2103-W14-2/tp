## Project: ConciergeBook 

ConciergeBook (CB) is a **desktop app for hotel receptionists to efficiently manage guest bookings via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConciergeBook can help you optimise how you manage your rooms, your guests and all new and existing bookings - faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `addPerson`, `findPerson`, `deletePerson`, `editPerson` and `listPerson` [\#72]()
    * Added documentation for new potential command: `getBill` [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated User Stories
