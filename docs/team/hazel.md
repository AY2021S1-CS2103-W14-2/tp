## Project: ConciergeBook 

ConciergeBook (CB) is a **desktop app for hotel receptionists to efficiently manage guest bookings via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConciergeBook can help you optimise how you manage your rooms, your guests and all new and existing bookings - faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
